A 'Why' in it's own simplistic way is the foundation of giving out solutions to all the complexities of the universe. The irony of this word is, being a question in itself, it drives you to build an answer. The reason that we humans developed to an extent such as today is because we challenged ourselves and we have the power to question ourselves and build logically and rationally sound solutions for the questions.

I recently joined Go-jek to work as a Product Engineer and I discovered that people here have an eccentric habit of asking why before making a concrete decision. They believe in pushing themselves towards the solution until there is no ambiguity regarding the decision. This approach enables them to build products efficiently.

The general practice that should be followed is you develop an abstract solution to your `why`. Extract out the abstraction causing elements in the solutions and re-run a why. This approach can be linked to breadth first search. You start off with the first node(the original question) and move on to the next possible solutions. Here, you have to raise another why to select out of all the possible branches(solutions). Eventually, this technique aides us in exploring all the possible answers to a question and enables us to make sound decisions.

The power of why is not just limited to decision making. Why is someone more successful than another or why are a few people content while others are sad etc, the solutions to all such questions can be traced to the habit of asking a why. An individual can't be successful until he knows why he is doing what he is doing. Every single individual has reasons to be happy and reasons to be sad. The difference is just that the happy person questions as to why should he remain sad while the sad one just glooms over his misery.

Every why you ask yourself will make you better than who you were.
